# LocalEventManagementSystem

The web application was made using Java (Spring MVC). Two types of users are present - admin and visitor. 
Admin adds new locations, categories, events and manages visitors in such a way that they can deny their access. 
Each new user can register during the first visit to the application. 
The user can browse the available categories, locations and events in the local area.
